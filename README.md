Divine Shred is a small game project created for the Action Button [Goblin Bunker Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/goblin-bunker-game-jam-february-2024) for February 2024 with the prompt "fell from the sky".

Check out the game on Itch.io: [https://17shinsen.itch.io/divine-shred](https://17shinsen.itch.io/divine-shred)

The game is written, pretty hastily, in Lua and is built against the PlayDate SDK v2.0.3.

### Objective of the game

You control a snowboarder character which falls from the sky and then progresses down the side of a mountain occasionally getting air from conveniently placed rocks. While in the air, there will be prompts to enter directions on the D-pad, completing these tricks will reward you with a score bonus which will be displayed at the end of the game.
